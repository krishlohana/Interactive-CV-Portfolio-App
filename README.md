# Interactive-CV-Portfolio-App

## This project aims to develop an interactive web application that serves as an online portfolio/CV for users, where potential employers can view detailed information about the individual and express interest in hiring. The application features:

- User Profiles: Showcase of personal details, skills, work experience, education, and projects.
- Employer Interest Form: A form that allows employers to indicate which candidate they are interested in and the specific job roles or projects they are seeking help with.

- Data Storage: The application uses MongoDB to store the form data and candidate profiles securely.
- Real-Time Interaction: Employers can submit inquiries through the interest form, which is stored in the database and displayed in real-time on the candidate's dashboard.
- Responsive Design: The web app is designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring users can access it across all devices.
